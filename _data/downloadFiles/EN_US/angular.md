### HTML - Fundamentals:
- HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

- Learning which tags are required for basic HTML
- Creating a text paragraph
- Displaying an image
- Knowing the difference between 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', etc.
- Creating a hyperlinked text
- Creating a form with relevant fields
- Creating an ordered or unordered list of items
- Creating a list of items within a dropdown list
- Linking to a CSS file
- Creating a table
- Adding IDs and classes

### CSS - Fundamentals:
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

### JavaScript - Fundamentals:
- JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language and is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.

### Object-oriented Programming Concepts:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- How objects work
- Creating and using constructors
- What classes are
- Creating and using Methods
- How encapsulation works
- What inheritance is
- What polymorphism is
- How interfaces work
- What abstractions are

### RxJS - Fundamentals:
- RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array methods (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.
- Creating asynchronous programs

### Observer pattern:
- In software design, the Observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
- Understanding what Design Patterns are
- Updating several elements simultaneously using Observers
- Declaring subjects
- Creating event-based programs

- Showing an Angular page on the browser
- Performing Server-side rendering

### Angular - Routing:
- In a Single Page Application (SPA), all of your application's functions exist in a single HTML page. As users access your application's features, the browser needs to render only the parts that matter to the user, instead of loading a new page. This pattern can significantly improve your application's user experience. To define how users navigate through your application, you use routes. Add routes to define how users navigate from one part of your application to another. You can also configure routes to guard against unexpected or unauthorized behavior.
- Navigating to a component
- Including a route parameter
- Controllung your user's navigation flow with route guarding
