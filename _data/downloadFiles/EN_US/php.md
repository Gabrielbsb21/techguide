### Object-oriented Programming Concepts:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- How objects work
- Creating and using constructors
- What classes are
- Creating and using Methods
- How encapsulation works
- What inheritance is
- What polymorphism is
- How interfaces work
- What abstractions are

### Cloud - Fundamentals:
- Cloud, or cloud computing, is the distribution of computing services over the Internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. A cloud is composed of various computing resources, ranging from the computers themselves (or instances, in cloud terminology) to networks, storage, databases, and everything around them. In other words, everything that is normally needed to set up the equivalent of a server room, or even a complete data center, will be ready to use, configured, and run.
- Knowing the difference between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS
- Knowing the largest cloud providers
- Specializing in a specific provider of your choice

It can even be used for effects such as animation.

- Learning about the display of an element ('block', 'inline', 'inline-block')
- Learning how to position images in relation to text
- Learning about alignment
- Learning about font style
- Learning the differences and advantages of using the different units of measurement in CSS (%, relative, etc)
- Connecting to the elements (IDs, classes) of an HTML file
- Changing the characteristics of an element when the mouse hovers over it
- Learning box-sizing
- Learning Flexbox
- Learning Grid
