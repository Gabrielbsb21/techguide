### Object-oriented Programming Concepts:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- How objects work
- Creating and using constructors
- What classes are
- Creating and using Methods
- How encapsulation works
- What inheritance is
- What polymorphism is
- How interfaces work
- What abstractions are
