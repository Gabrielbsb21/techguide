### Java - Fundamentals:
- Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.

### Object-oriented Programming Concepts:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- How objects work
- Creating and using constructors
- What classes are
- Creating and using Methods
- How encapsulation works
- What inheritance is
- What polymorphism is

### JVM:
- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a program that loads and runs Java applications, converting the bytecodes into machine-executable code. The JVM is responsible for managing the applications as they run. Thanks to the Java Virtual Machine, programs written in Java can run on any hardware and software platform that has a version of the JVM, thus making these applications independent of the platform they run on.

### Java - Memory management:
- In Java, memory management is the process of allocation and de-allocation of objects, called Memory management. Java does memory management automatically. Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector. Thus, we are not required to implement memory management logic in our application.
- Understanding how memory and its management work in Java

### Spring Framework:
- Spring is an open source framework for the Java platform. It is a non-intrusive framework, based on the Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection design patterns. In Spring, the container is responsible for "instantiating" classes from a Java application and defining the dependencies between them through a configuration file in XML format, inferences from the framework, what is called auto-wiring, or even annotations on classes, methods and properties. This way, Spring enables low coupling between classes in an object-oriented application.
