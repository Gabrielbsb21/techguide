### HTML - Fundamentals:
- HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
- Learning which tags are required for basic HTML
- Creating a text paragraph
- Displaying an image
- Knowing the difference between 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', etc.
- Creating a hyperlinked text
- Creating a form with relevant fields
- Creating an ordered or unordered list of items
- Creating a list of items within a dropdown list
- Linking to a CSS file
- Creating a table
- Adding IDs and classes

### CSS - Fundamentals:
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.
- Learning the visual structure of a page, with 'margin' and 'padding'
- Establishing the size with 'width' and 'height'
- Learning about the position of an element ('static', 'relative' or 'absolute')
- Learning about the display of an element ('block', 'inline', 'inline-block')
- Learning how to position images in relation to text
- Learning about alignment
- Learning about font style
- Learning the differences and advantages of using the different units of measurement in CSS (%, relative, etc)
- Connecting to the elements (IDs, classes) of an HTML file
- Changing the characteristics of an element when the mouse hovers over it
- Learning box-sizing
- Learning Flexbox

## Level 2

### JavaScript - Callbacks and Promises:
- A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods - instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
- A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
- An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.
- Understanding the concept of asynchronous programming
- Writing asynchronous code understanding the concept of promises in JavaScript
- Using JavaScript methods, keywords and objects for handling promises like 'Async/Await', '.then()', 'Promise', etc
- Learning in which situations you need to use asynchronous programming
- Calling APIs with `fetch()`

### Object-oriented Programming Concepts:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- How objects work
- Creating and using constructors
- What classes are
- Creating and using Methods
- How encapsulation works
- What inheritance is
- What polymorphism is
- How interfaces work
- What abstractions are
