### Object-oriented Programming Concepts:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- How objects work
- Creating and using constructors
- What classes are
- Creating and using Methods
- How encapsulation works
- What inheritance is
- What polymorphism is
- How interfaces work
- What abstractions are

- A Fragment represents the behavior or a part of the user interface in a host Activity. You can combine multiple fragments into a single Activity to create a multi-panel UI and reuse a fragment in multiple activities.

### Android - Persistence:
- The concept of "data persistence" refers to ensuring that the information inputted into an application will be stored in a medium where it can be retrieved consistently. In other words, they are permanent records that are not lost when the session is closed.
- In Android we can persistently store App-specific or shared files, primitive type information with preferences, and structured database data.

### Android - Image loading:
- Images come in different sizes and shapes. In most cases, they are larger than needed for the UI of an app. Since we are working with limited memory, Android uses a bitmap decoding technique, to avoid all the work of using this we have several libraries that facilitate this process.
- What is Bitmap

### Kotlin - Asynchronous:
- In asynchronous programming, the functions are not executed in order. We can interrupt the code to get some other information needed to continue execution. This means that the code waits for another part of the code, and while it waits, it can execute the other parts.
- Learning the possibilities to run code asynchronously on Android
- Getting to know the java.concurrent package and its solutions

### Kotlin - Communication with APIs:
- An API is an interface that software developers use to programmatically interact with software components or resources outside of their own code. An even simpler definition is that an API is the part of a software component that is accessible to other components.
- Performing HTTP requests to communicate with online services such as REST API is fundamental to most Android apps. As such, it is important to know the main tools and techniques needed for this type of functionality.
- Knowing the most famous libraries in the Android world for making requests - Retrofit, Ktor or Volley
- Setting up requests to execute asynchronously
- Converting objects to JSON and vice-versa

### Kotlin - Dependency Injection:
- Dependency Injection is a design pattern in which a class requests dependencies from external sources instead of creating them.
- When writing code in Android projects, it is often the case that a feature uses library code, such as Room to save data or Retrofit to make requests to the REST API. These libraries are known as dependencies in our codes, precisely because of their necessity to perform the expected action. Using these libraries easily anywhere in the app can have its challenges, such as providing unique instances and performing all the necessary configuration for correct operation. For this, we use dependency injection tools that make our job easier.
- Learning how to use the dependency injection technique and one of the most common Android tools for this - Hilt, Dagger or Koin

### Android - Core App quality:
- When writing an Android App, there are a number of requirements to ensure an expected quality, such as compatibility of the App with the navigation expected by the Android system, or the gestures, etc.
- The requirements are classified as - Visual experience, Functionality, Performance and stability, Privacy and security, Google Play, and Testing procedure
- Fulfilling all or almost all requirements means that the App has a higher quality for the users

### Android - CI/CD:
- CI/CD is short for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery. It is a software development practice that aims to make code integration more efficient through automated builds and testing.
- When implementing new App functionality, we need to ensure that all deliveries will work correctly. To do this, we can use continuous integration and continuous delivery techniques, this way we speed up the evolution of the App and try to ensure the expected behaviors at the same time.
- Knowing one of the tools to do continuous delivery, such as Firebase Test Lab, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc

### Android - Security and Monitoring:
- As your project grows, it becomes more visible, attracting both a larger audience and potential attackers. Application security, from the earliest stages of development, is crucial to protecting the integrity of the project and the privacy of users. Adopting robust security practices and keeping up to date is essential to avoid threats and guarantee a safe experience for your company and its users
- Making sure you understand your project's needs
- Monitoring is fundamental to understanding how your application operates in production.
- Understanding the user flow and identifying possible funnels helps to improve your project strategy and can be a determining factor in the application's success.
- The ability to anticipate and predict problem scenarios before they affect the end user is a crucial factor.
