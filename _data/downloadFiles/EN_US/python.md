- Knowing the primitive types
- Declaring variables, considering the different types
- Using conditional structures ('if', 'else')
- Knowing the assignment and comparison operators
- Using repetition structures and loops ('while', 'for')
- Using functions, passing parameters and arguments
- Manipulating methods
- Manipulating arrays and lists
- Getting data from an API
- Creating constructors

### Object-oriented Programming Concepts:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- How objects work
- Creating and using constructors
- What classes are
- Creating and using Methods
- How encapsulation works
- What inheritance is

### Python - Lambdas and Closures:
- Lambda functions are nothing more than anonymous functions. While normal functions can be created using def as a prefix, lambda functions are created using lambda.
- A closure in Python is an inner function object, a function that behaves like an object, that remembers and has access to variables in the local scope where it was created, even after the outer function has finished executing. It can also be defined as a means of binding data to a function without passing it as a parameter.

### Python - Asynchronous:
- In asynchronous programming, the functions are not executed in order. We can interrupt the code to get some other information needed to continue execution. This means that the code waits for another part of the code, and while it waits, it can execute the other parts.

- Coroutines are a generalization of subroutines. They are used for cooperative multitasking where a process yields control voluntarily, periodically or when idle, in order to allow multiple applications to run simultaneously.
- Dealing with concurrency
