### JavaScript - Fundamentals:
- JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language and is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
- Knowing the primitive types
- Declaring variables, considering the difference between 'var', 'let' and 'const
- Using conditional structures ('if', 'else')
- Know the assignment and comparison operators ('=', '==', '===')
- Using repetition structures and loops ('while', 'for')
- Using functions, passing parameters and arguments
- Manipulating arrays and lists
- Getting data from an API
- Making asynchronous calls using 'Async/Await', 'Promise', etc

### JavaScript - Callbacks and Promises:
- A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods - instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
- A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
- An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.
- Understanding the concept of asynchronous programming
- Writing asynchronous code understanding the concept of promises in JavaScript
- Using JavaScript methods, keywords and objects for handling promises like 'Async/Await', '.then()', 'Promise', etc
- Learning in which situations you need to use asynchronous programming
- Calling APIs with `fetch()`

### Object-oriented Programming Concepts:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. Some of the main concepts are classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation.
