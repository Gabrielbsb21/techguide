### HTML - Fundamentals:
- HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

- Learning which tags are required for basic HTML
- Creating a text paragraph
- Displaying an image
- Knowing the difference between 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', etc.
- Creating a hyperlinked text
- Creating a form with relevant fields
- Creating an ordered or unordered list of items
- Creating a list of items within a dropdown list

### CSS - Fundamentals:
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

- Learning how to position images in relation to text
- Learning about alignment
- Learning about font style
- Learning the differences and advantages of using the different units of measurement in CSS (%, relative, etc)

### JavaScript - Fundamentals:
- JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language and is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

### DOM - Fundamentals:
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

### JavaScript - Callbacks and Promises:
- A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods - instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
- A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
- An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.
- Understanding the concept of asynchronous programming
- Writing asynchronous code understanding the concept of promises in JavaScript
- Using JavaScript methods, keywords and objects for handling promises like 'Async/Await', '.then()', 'Promise', etc
- Learning in which situations you need to use asynchronous programming
- Calling APIs with `fetch()`

They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.
